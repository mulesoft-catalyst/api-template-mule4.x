# API Template for Mule 4

API Templates act as foundations for developers to start building APIs. They need not worry about adding dependencies and configure autodiscovery as all is handled by the template. The template utilizes 2 Mule Extensions as follows,

1. JSON Logger: This is used for Logging in the API and is custom plugin built by Andres Ramirez from Services and is present at https://github.com/mulesoft-catalyst/json-logger/tree/mule-4.x . Please publish this to your private Exchange before publishing the template. The guide to publish it present the above link
2. Error Handler Plugin: This is a common error handler that is fully customizable and is used by the template to handle errors. In case of an error the On Error Propgate is used which sends the information to the error handler which then handles the error, maps to the error object and prints it. This was built by Biswa Mohanty from Services and is present at https://github.com/mulesoft-catalyst/error-handler-plugin. You need to publish this to Exchange before using the template.
